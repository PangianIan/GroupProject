                <h2>
                    Early Life and Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Koji Kondo is a Japanese composer from Nagoya, Japan. He started learning music 
                    in kindergarten when he learned to play the electric organ at the age of five. 
                    From there, he played marimba in a school band and the electric organ for a cover 
                    band that he was a member of. Despite all of this and going to Osaka University, 
                    Kondo never was classically trained in music. However, he was eventually mentored by 
                    Yukio Kaneoka on sound programming when he started working for Nintendo.

                <h2>Early Nintendo Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Koji Kondo's first work for Nintendo was on Punch-Out!! working on some of the 
                    game audio design. After his work on Devil World, Shigeru Miyamoto sought to work 
                    for Nintendo R&D4. After joining, Koji Kondo worked on the theme for Super Mario 
                    Bros, which would become his first majorly known work. After all, since then, the 
                    theme has been in most of the Mario games and in over 50 concerts. It was even the 
                    most popular ringtone at one point. After his work on the original Mario's music, 
                    his next work was for the original The Legend Of Zelda game. Here, he made 4
                    pieces of background music, the main overworld theme becoming another immensly successful 
                    piece.

                <h2>Proceeding Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Since then, Kondo has been one of the most notable names in video game musics. 
                    Kondo continued to work on Mario and Zelda soundtracks (who had both become incredibly 
                    successful series by this point), but also worked on other series like Yoshi's Island 
                    and Star Fox. While he has recently taken on more of an executive role, Kondo still composes 
                    music for many of these series.

                    Interesting Facts
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Koji Kondo often worked on many of his early game compositions on his own. The 
                        last composition he did this with was Ocarina of Time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kondo tried to incorporate elements of dance music into his music based on
                        the ideas of Miyamoto about how game music should have music that was in sync 
                        with the game elements. Kondo believed this would give the games a feeling of 
                        motion you would get in the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kondo's once said his favorite albums were Made in Japan and Brain Salad Surgery.
