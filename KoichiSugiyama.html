                    Koichi Sugiyama
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Early Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sugiyama started by working for Nippon Cultural Broadcasting as a reporter and 
                    entertainer. Eventually, he became a director of Fuji TV, but left in 1965 to 
                    focus on music composition. For about two decades after, he began to compose 
                    for commercials, shows, and other forms of media. Some notable ones are Cyborg 
                    009 and his assistance on Godzilla vs. Hedorah. Overall, this previous work 
                    helped make him a celebrity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Enix and Death
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1980's, Sugiyama sent a letter to Enix about a shogi game they had made. 
                    Suprised to have recieved a letter from someone of Sugiyama's fame, they asked 
                    him to compose for them given his knowledge of their games. Sugiyama accepted, 
                    and the first game he composed for them was Wingman 2. However, much more well 
                    known, he later composed for Dragon Quest, where his musical score was 
                    well known for being the first to use a live orchestra to record it and was 
                    seen as revolutionary. Sugiyama even released a CD based purely on the games where 
                    he had an orchestra playing. This was done with the help of the Tokyo Strings Ensemble. 
                    He has since composed for every single Dragon Quest game up to Dragon Quest XI. 
                    He also began to hold many events where the Tokyo Strings Ensemble and the 
                    London Philharmonic Orchestra would play songs he had composed, as well as those 
                    of seventeen others. For his work, Sugiyama was declared a Person of Cultural 
                    Merit in the country of Japan. Sugiyama died in 2021 from septic shock. Afterwords, 
                    a TV broadcast was done on Nippon TV to celebrate his life and work.

                <h2>
                    Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sugiyama is well known for his use of motifs throughout his work. As an example, 
                    every Dragon Quest game has practically identical versions of the Overture theme. 
                    It has also been said that his style was inspired by the Baroque and Classical 
                    periods of music. Sugiyama reportedly used drafts of stories he was given in order 
                    to determine the correct tone and feeling needed throughout the piece.
