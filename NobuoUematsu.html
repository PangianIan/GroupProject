                    Early Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobuo Uematsu is a Japanese composer from the Kochi Prefecture. While he was at Kanagawa
                    University studying English, he played music in several bands and composed minor jingles.
                    He never had any formal training, but he was self-taught in the piano and learned to write 
                    music. Eventually, he was approached by his friend Hironobu Sakaguchi and asked
                    if he would like to compose music for the game Cruise Chaser Blassty. Nobuo Uematsu 
                    then continued to help write music for Square, the company Sakaguchi worked at. However, 
                    none of the games he composed for were extremely successful until FInal Fantasy.

                <h2>Final Fantasy and Square</h2>
                <p>
                    After Final Fantasy became a commercial hit, Uematsu began to compose a lot of music for Square.
                    To begin with, he composed for pretty much every Final Fantasy game after that, which had become an
                    incredibly popular series of the genre. In addition, he helped compose the music for other games by 
                    Square, like Chrono Trigger. After the success of his music in the games, Uematsu even started 
                    his own band called The Black Mages with some of his coworkers: Kenichiro Fukui, Tsuyoshi Sekito, 
                    Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya. This band, as the name implies,
                    mainly performed songs from Final Fantasy games, but did release a few new titles like 
                    "Blue Blast - Winning the Rainbow."

            <div>
                <h2>Dog Ear Records and Other Works</h2>
                <p>
                    After he decided his time working directly for Square was over, Uematsu created 
                    Dog Ear Records as his own record and studio and production company. Uematsu has stated 
                    the main reason for this split was simply due to the moving of Square Enix's headquarters, 
                    which he had no intention of doing. After this, while still working with Square Enix, Uematsu 
                    began working for other studios as well like Mistwalker which was made by his Sakaguchi. 
                    Uematsu even wrote songs for some Nintendo games like the main theme of Super Smash Bros Brawl.
                    Many of Uematsu's works even went on to be inducted in several Halls of Fame. However, Uematsu 
                    began a hiatus in 2018 due to health concerns and the stress of work, which had even left him 
                    hospitalized.
