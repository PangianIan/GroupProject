                    Toby Fox is a fairly new name to videogames. His first publically released and recognized project was the EarthBound Halloween 
                    Hack which was a fanmade hack of the Nintendo SNES game Earthbound that added some more horror-related themes. After that, he 
                    worked on the music for a fairly well-known webcomic, Homestuck.

                    Undertale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, in 2013, Toby fox released the demo of a game he was working on, Undertale. For Undertale, Toby Fox was 
                    both the head programmer and composer. Undertale went on to be a significant success in 2015 when it came out, selling over 
                    a million copies. Along with it, the music was also regarded well. In fact, it was recieved so well that in 2020, Toby Fox held 
                    a live concert purely of Undertale's music. <a href="https://youtu.be/srZdDAJbHfc">It was also streamed on Youtube.</a> 
                    Overall, it was successful enough to allow Fox to release a sequel.

                    Ater the success of Undertale, Toby Fox began the develpment and compsing for Deltarune, its sequel. Its first chapter
                    released on November 1, 2018. Since then, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fox has only been able to release one more chapter,
                    but has stated that he has composed several pieces for the game when the programming is able to continue. As of October 30th, 
                    2023, no new news has been reported on the last three chapters.
