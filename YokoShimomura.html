                <h2>
                    Early Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shimomura was born in Hyogo, Japan. She started learning piano and composing 
                    music around the age of five. She then went to the Osaka College for Music 
                    and graduated as a piano major in 1988. After thinking of being a piano 
                    instructor, she decided to instead apply to video game companies due to her 
                    enjoyment of video games. She was eventually offered a job at Capcom and accepted 
                    it (to the dismay of her parents and instructors who say it as a lesser form 
                    of music).

                <h2>
                    Early Career in Video Games
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Capcom, Shimomura composed for over sixteen games like Street Fighter II 
                    and Final Fight. Many of these games even released albums of the soundtracks that 
                    sold well, including ones that were solely her work. She also joined the band 
                    at Capcom, Alpha Lyla, who she performed with live several times. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1993, however, she left Capcom to join Square, stating that the "classical 
                    style" of Square fit her style more than Capcom. This is because she was 
                    mostly constricted to the arcade section of Capcom instead of console games. 
                    To begin at Square, she made the score for Live A Live. She also created the scores 
                    to many of their big projects like Super Mario RPG and Front Mission, which she 
                    worked on concurrently.

                <h2>Later Works</h2>
                <p>
                    After the introduction of the PlayStation, Shimomura made a few more scores 
                    for fairly high-profile games. These include ones such as Parasite Eve and 
                    Legend of Mana (the later of which Shimomura states was the best representation 
                    of her work). Meanwhile, Parasite eve was the first work of her to include a vocal 
                    song, which would become very popular in her later work. Eventually, she began to 
                    work on what would be one of the biggest turning points of her career: the score 
                    for Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts sold extremely well and many of the praises 
                    were about the soundtrack itself. It was also the last work Shimomura did working 
                    under Square, as she left on maternity leave and decided to do freelance work 
                    afterwards. Since then, she has worked on every Kingdom Hearts soundtrack, 
                    the Mario and Luigi rpgs, and Final Fantasy XV. Overall, she has become one 
                    of the more recognizable video game composers in history.
