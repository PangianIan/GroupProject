                    Early Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jeremy Soule is from Keokuk, Iowa. He is the son of a music teacher and graphic 
                    designer. Jeremy Soule started having an interest in symphony orchestras and 
                    learning the piano from an early age. Eventually, when those around him learned 
                    of this talent and interest, he began recieving private lessons from Western 
                    Illinoise University professors. While he never attended the school to recieve a 
                    degree, he stated that he had the equivalent of one before leaving high school. 
                    Soule also had an interest in video games from a young age, but stated that the 
                    experience would be better if the musical score could be improved. Thus, he sent 
                    a portfolio to Square based on what he believed was good game music, and they hired him.

                    <h2>
                        Early Works
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Soule's first composition work was the score for Secret of Evermore. 
                        Due to technical limitations leading to not bein able to fully implement 
                        ideas, Soule had to simply use noises like wind blowing and waves in the 
                        score to try to create an atmosphere. Eventually, Square decided to move, 
                        and a new company called Humongous Entertainment had started. Therefore, 
                        to avoid a move, Soule decided to apply there. While there, Soule began 
                        working on several children's point and click games like Putt Putt, 
                        Pajama Sam, and Freddi Fish. After this, he began working on other games 
                        like Total Annihilation. For this game, Soule bet a year of his salary that 
                        the soundtrack was important to making the game successful in an RTS saturated 
                        market. It was also the first time Soule worked with a full orchestra. However, 
                        Soule's work paid off, and even wone him an his first award.

                    <h2>Soule Media</h2>
                    <p>
                        After working on other games and expansions for Humongous Entertainment, the brothers 
                        Jeremy and Julian Soule both went on to form Soule Media (which would 
                        become Artistry Entertainment). The first big project they took on was Icewind 
                        Dale, which would win them an award from IGN and Gamespot for the soundtrack.
                        They then worked on five Harry Potter games from 2001 to 2005, most of which were 
                        nominated for awards by various intitutions for their soundtracks. Finally, he 
                        soundtracked for three soon to be best sellers: Morrowind, Dungeon Siege, and 
                        Neverwinter Nights.

                    <p>
                        Many of Soule's later works were on top sellers. Soule worked on big names 
                        in the remaining years of the 2000's like 
                        Oblivion, Guild Wars, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Warhammer games.
                        Finally, he worked on even more big games like Skyrim, and another Guild Wars game.
