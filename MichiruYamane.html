                </h1>
                <h2>Castlevania</h2>
                <p>
                    Michiru Yamane is a Japanese composer who is likely most known for their work with Konami. Specifically, she 
                    has been one of the main composers for the Castlevania series since 1994 when they released Castlevania: Bloodlines.
                    Since then, she has worked on some of their most successful titles, like the critically acclaimed Symphony of the 
                    Night. In addition, she has played much of her Castlevania music live at many of their orchestral performances
                </p>
                <h2>Other Works</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to Castlevania, Yamane has worked on several other Konami titles. Her first work has for King's Valley
                    II, and she proceeded to start working on their Track and Field games as well. However, most of these were simple
                    fanfares used in short bursts for certain events. After this, she worked on several of Konami's shoot-em-up titles
                    where she learned more about the Famicom's limitations on sound quality and how to bypass this and make quality
                    music despite it. Her first lead composition was on Ganbare Goemon 2 where she learned more about mixing sound 
                    samples digitally from her coworkers. After this, she began working on Castlevania. After she left Konami in 2008, 
                    she began doing more freelance work for games, movies, and other forms of media while still helping with the Castlevania 
                    music. It was during this time that she helped make the music for Skullgirls.
                </p>
                <h2>Style</h2>
                <p>
                    Michiru Yamane has been influenced by many classical composers like the famous Bach and Debussy. In fact, she 
                    studied Bach's works in college and was mainly trained in orchestral composition. However, she has stated that many 
                    modern styles have also influenced her work, such as bossa nova and techno pop.
